		  Proposal To Move An Existing Database Of An Existing Webservices From Mongodb To Postgres


PostgreSQL has a strongly typed schema that leaves very little room for errors . We can change the tables in PostgreSQL without requiring to lock it for operation . Postgres also supports JSONB, which lets you create unstructured data. The biggest advantage and disadvantage of Mongo is that it has flexible schema . There is no strict schema .

Postgres is convenient and supports transactions. Postgres is faster in sorting. Mongo is flexible and in-consistent performance . Insertion is faster in MongoDB . MongoDB rocks in joins and updating. Postgres has to check foreign key constraints.
